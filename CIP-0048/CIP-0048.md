# Abstract
This standard proposes a fully on chain method to store and access metadata via the use of references or pointers to data. 
This would allow users of 721 to increase or reduce the amount of data stored on chain. 

# Motivation
- Large token mints that duplicated data could be dramatically reduced in size by pointing to one transaction payload that contains a ‘boilerplate’ structure.
- 16kB is the upper limit of data in each transaction but If a user wanted more there is no alternative than to store that data off-chain using an external service such as ipfs. 
- The use of pointers to data is an extremely powerful tool. For example If a pointer, pointed to pointers you could soon minic something like the ext2 filesystem fully on chain. 
- The aforementioned is all currently possible but there is no informational standard.
This CIP aims to describe is a standard so that if a user does want to reduce or increase there metadata size it can be queried by 3rd parties that look for the version 2 tag attached within the 721 metadatum transaction label


Specifically, this proposal aims to solve for the following:

* Provide a mechanism to reduce duplicated metadata into one or multiple transactions that can be referenced
* Provide a mechanism that allows on chain data to be referenced
* Provide a mechanism to reference on chain data in a set order

# Specification
|reserved 721 metadata tag |description | example
|---|---| --- |
|references, refs, r | contains data tag and src tag | ```'r':{"data:"text/plain","src":[0,1]}```|
|payload, p | contains raw data | ```'p':{ "0":["h","e","l","l","o"], "1":"world" }``` |
|version| this is described in 721 | not sure if it should be version 1.1? instead of 2|
|data| contains the data type MIME | for example if base 64, data:"text/plain;base64"|
|src|contains a list of poitners to payloads | ```"src":[0,1]``` or ``` "src":["payload0","payload1"]```|


*Please note I offer optional single char names to allow futher reduction in metadata size if desired*

{
   "721":{
      "<POLICY_ID>":{
         "<NFT_NAME_B16>":{
            "project":"<PROJECT>",
            "name":"<NFT_NAME>",
            "references":{
               "data":"text/plain"
               "src":[
                  0,
                  1
               ]
            }
         },
         "payload":{
            "0":["Hello"],"1":["World!"]
         },
         "version":"2"
      }
   }
}
```
# retrieve payload information using references
1. Find all transactions with the 721 label
2. Check the version tag
3. If a payload is found append that to an map or some data structure 
4. Given a nft find there references
5. Concatenate the data for all given references

In example 
```
nft 0 has the payload "p":{"0":""Hello","1":"World" } and the references "r":[0,1]
nft 0 == "HELLOWORLD"
```
```
nft 1 has no payload and the references [0]
nft 1 == "HELLO"
```
```
nft 2 has no payload and the references [1,0] (note the order)
nft 2 == "WORLDHELLO"
 ```

# backwards compatibility
Used the version tag described 

# Further considerations
I believe this needs to be better defined 
```
 "references":{
               "mediaType":"text/plain",
               "src":[
                  0,
                  1
               ]
            }
```
